# Introduction to GIS Programming

## Course Description

This course provides an in-depth exploration of GIS programming using the Python programming language. Students will learn how to leverage various Python libraries and frameworks to process, analyze, and visualize geospatial data.

The course begins with an introduction to the course and setup of the necessary software environment. Students will then dive into the fundamental concepts of Python, including variables, data types, data structures, string operations, looping, and control statements. They will also learn about functions, classes, file handling, and exception handling.

The course then focuses on the application of Python in the geospatial domain. Students will be introduced to Leafmap, a powerful library for creating interactive web maps, and will learn how to visualize vector and raster data. They will also explore 3D mapping with MapLibre and gain exposure to SAMGeo and HyperCoast, two specialized geospatial libraries.

Throughout the course, students will participate in hands-on labs and projects that reinforce the concepts learned in the lectures. The course culminates in a final project, where students will demonstrate their ability to apply the skills and knowledge acquired during the semester.

By the end of this course, students will have a strong understanding of Python programming and its applications in the geospatial domain. They will be equipped with the necessary skills to tackle a wide range of geospatial analysis and visualization tasks using Python.
